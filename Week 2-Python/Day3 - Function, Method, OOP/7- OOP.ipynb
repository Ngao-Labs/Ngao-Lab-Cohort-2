    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) tends to be one of the major obstacles for beginners when they are first starting to learn Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many tutorials and lessons covering OOP so feel free to Google search other lessons, and I have also put some links to other useful tutorials online at the bottom of this Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lesson we will construct our knowledge of OOP in Python by building on the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Objects\n",
    "* Using the *class* keyword\n",
    "* Creating class attributes\n",
    "* Creating methods in a class\n",
    "* Learning about Inheritance\n",
    "* Learning about Polymorphism\n",
    "* Learning about Special Methods for classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start the lesson by remembering about the Basic Python Objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects\n",
    "In Python, *everything is an object*. Remember from previous lectures we can use type() to check the type of object something is:"

    "So we know all these things are objects, so how can we create our own Object types? That is where the <code>class</code> keyword comes in.\n",
    "## class\n",
    "User defined objects are created using the <code>class</code> keyword. The class is a blueprint that defines the nature of a future object. From classes we can construct instances. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class. For example, above we created the object <code>lst</code> which was an instance of a list object. \n",

    "By convention we give classes a name that starts with a capital letter. Note how <code>x</code> is now the reference to our new instance of a Sample class. In other words, we **instantiate** the Sample class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside of the class we currently just have pass. But we can define class attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **attribute** is a characteristic of an object.\n",
    "A **method** is an operation we can perform with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can create a class called Dog. An attribute of a dog may be its breed or its name, while a method of a dog may be defined by a .bark() method which returns a sound.\n",

    "There is a special method called:\n",

    "Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class. They are used to perform operations with the attributes of our objects. Methods are a key concept of the OOP paradigm. They are essential to dividing responsibilities in programming, especially in large applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. The newly formed classes are called derived classes, the classes that we derive from are called base classes. Important benefits of inheritance are code reuse and reduction of complexity of a program. The derived classes (descendants) override or extend the functionality of base classes (ancestors).\n"

    "\n",
    "We've learned that while functions can take in different arguments, methods belong to the objects they act on. In Python, *polymorphism* refers to the way in which different object classes can share the same method name, and those methods can be called from the same place even though a variety of different objects might be passed in. The best way to explain this is by example:"
