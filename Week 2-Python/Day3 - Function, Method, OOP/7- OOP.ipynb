    "There are many, many tutorials and lessons covering OOP so feel free to Google search other lessons, and I have also put some links to other useful tutorials online at the bottom of this Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lesson we will construct our knowledge of OOP in Python by building on the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Objects\n",
    "* Using the *class* keyword\n",
    "* Creating class attributes\n",
    "* Creating methods in a class\n",
    "* Learning about Inheritance\n",
    "* Learning about Polymorphism\n",
    "* Learning about Special Methods for classes\n",

    "## Objects\n",
    "In Python, *everything is an object*. Remember from previous lectures we can use type() to check the type of object something is:"
