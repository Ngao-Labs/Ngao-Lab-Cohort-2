    "Strings are used in Python to record text information, such as names. Strings in Python are actually a *sequence*, which basically means Python keeps track of every element in the string as a sequence. For example, Python understands the string \"hello' to be a sequence of letters in a specific order. This means we will be able to use indexing to grab particular letters (like the first letter, or the last letter).\n",
